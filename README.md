# Description

This is the York Vision 4 Theme that is being created for the UK student newspaper [York Vision](http://www.yorkvision.co.uk). It attempts to integrate mainy of the new features that are available in HTML5 since the York Vision 3 Theme was created in 2013.

Where as the third iteration of the theme was built using Twitter Boostrap the 4th generation is built using the Bourbon family of SASS libraries and therefore has a very different feel to it. The York Vision newspaper is attempting to move away from its generic tabloid aesthetic and towards a modern, cleaner feel.
